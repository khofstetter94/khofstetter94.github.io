>"When we’re growing, we’re more productive. And when I’m productive, I feel better." - Steve Haffenden

When I read through this article, I was hyper aware of the fact that I often relate with a fixed mindset. To summarize this article, I would say that having a growth mindset means having patience with yourself, understanding that obstacles are a part of the process, changing your perspective on something that you would typically deem as a bad or negative, and accepting criticism as it comes. Often times in life we are faced with difficult obstacles that we allow to slow or completely stunt our growth. Whether it be learning something new, a project at work, or within your personal relationships, difficulties will arise. A growth mindset would allow you to have an open mind and move through the hardships rather than go around. Give youself grace when taking a step back, and never ingore the problem. Remember why you started on this path in the first place and let it motivate you to push onward. 

## Reminders to myself for maintaining a growth mindset
- Take everything one step at a time
- It's okay to step away and return when refreshed 
- Remember that I chose this path for a reason, and the struggle will be worth it 
- Accept the bad and make concious decisions to improve

## About Me
Hello, my name is KC Hofstetter and I live in Seattle, WA. I have been working as a dental hygienist since I graduated college in 2017. Recently, I have found that my career was not meeting my professional goals, so I decided to make a switch! I do not have any experience in software development aside from a handful of free online courses. I'm very excited to dive into this complex career and see where it takes me! Outside of work, I enjoy travelling, reading, and spending as much time as I can with friends.
