# The Growth Mindset

[Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

- "That's where deliberate practice comes in. Deliberate practice can be summarized as:
  - Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individualâ€™s performance."

- Challenge yourself and put yourself out of your comfort zone often. Deliberate practice is not doing the same comfortable thing over and over again, its praciting things that mentally frustrate you over and over again

[Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

- Look for ways for your abilities to be developed
- Having a fixed mindset may have you thinking that your "intelligence had been up for judgement and (you) failed" when a challenge is presented
- The weight of failure can cause people with a fixed mindset to cheat rather than work hard to improve, they will also run from difficulty and find other people who failed so that they feel better
- "Praise the process not the talent", "Reward the effort and process, not the final correct result"

[Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

- "Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals"
- "Grit is having stamina"
- "Grit is sticking with your future day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality"
- "Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint"
- "Grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent"
- Use a growth mindset to grow your grit

[Alain de Botton on Redefining Success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

- Snobbery in the work environment is being judged as a person based entirely off of what you do for a living - this can cause lots of stress
- If you cant relate to someone, you most likely wont envy them
- Failure is very crushing due to "meritocracy" or a society that believes talent and skill will get you to the top and keep you there, and lack of those things will take you to the bottom and keep you there
- Fear of failure can come from the judgement and ridicule from others and also the loss of income and status
- "You can't be successful at everything"
- "Any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is"
- "We should make sure that (our ideas of success) are our own. We should focus in on our ideas, and make sure that we own them. We are truly the authors of our own ambition"

[Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment Tool](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.pdf)

- This evaluation is always interesting because I seem to never get the exact same results. Which goes to show that "Emotional intelligence is learnable and developmental". I score better in social/relational awareness rather than self awareness/management. I wouldnt say that I'm unaware of my own self, however there is much room for improvement here. Taking time to check in with my own emotions and how they affect myself and others around me is something that I can work on daily. I do pride myself in my awareness for others and their emotions, however this is also room for improvement here as well.

[Bias Self-Assessment](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.pdf)

- This assessment has always given me a little frustation, only because the two options for each question are so polar opposite and one is clearly the most correct answer. However, I still did not score a 5 for every question. When the assessment stated "Bias is a natual part of the human condition and how all our brains operate", I fully agreed. I believe I am aware of a lot of my biases but that doesn't make it easy to ignore them. I often need time and effort to acknoledge them and decide the best course of action. After the assessment, I also feel as though I lack a sense of confidence and high self-esteem, which can often make me non-confrontational on certain topics. This is something I am working on prior to entering the work environment.
