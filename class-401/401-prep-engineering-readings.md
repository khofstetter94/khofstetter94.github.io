## Discussion Questions

- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
  - My exerience in the health care field sets me apart from other employees. Working as a dental hygienist seems completely unrelated to software development but the soft skills that translate to other fields are relevant and useful. During my time as a hygienist, I developed strong skills in communication, attention to detail, problem solving, and patience to name a few. Working with people in such a vulnerable and challenging setting makes my people skills and professional skills unique assets.

- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  - Break the problem down into smaller solvable problems, then connecting the dots along the way
  - Read it twice, solve it manually with 3 sets of sample data, optimize the manual steps, write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code, replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code, optimize the real code (SOURCE: Solving Problems article, link above)
  - Take breaks and ASK FOR HELP

## Things I want to know more about

- Implementing the 5 whys problem within a software development team. Other websites for code challenges that I can use for interview prep.
