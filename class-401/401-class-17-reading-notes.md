[AWS Lambda Basics](https://www.serverless.com/aws-lambda)

- What is AWS Lambda?
  - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.
- Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.
  - Applications where individual tasks run for a short time, applications where each task is generally self-contained, and applications where there is a large difference between the lowest and highest levels in the workload of the application
- Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.
  - The concept of “serverless” computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions. “Serverless” doesn’t mean that there are no servers involved: it just means that the servers, the operating systems, the network layer and the rest of the infrastructure have already been taken care of, so that you can focus on writing application code.
