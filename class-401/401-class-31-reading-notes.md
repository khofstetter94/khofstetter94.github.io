# Context API

- [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

  - What can React Context provide your app?
    - Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
  - Why might we use Context?
    - Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.
  - Why should we use it sparingly?
    - Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

  - Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:
    - Takeaway 1: [What’s new in React 16.3](https://medium.com/@baphemot/whats-new-in-react-16-3-d2c9b7b6193b) Strict mode is a new way to make sure your code is following the best practices. It’s a component available under React.StrictMode and can be added to your application tree or subtree.
    - Takeaway 2: [React's new context API: toggle between local and global state](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reacts-new-context-api-how-to-toggle-between-local-and-global-state-c6ace81443d0) Not all premature optimizations are the root of all evil. You should find a good balance between simplicity and scalability. That is, you should pursue simple implementations, specially if you're building small applications. But, if you're planning to grow, you should look for simple implementations that are also easy to scale.
