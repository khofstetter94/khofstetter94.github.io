[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

- **What is node.js?** - Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
- **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?** - a JavaScript engine built sepcifically for Google Chrome and other Chrome based browsers
- **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?** - This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers
- **What is npm?** - a package manager and it is also the world’s largest software registry.
- **What version of node are you running on your machine?** - v18.3.0
- **What version of npm are you running on your machine?** - 8.11.0
- **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?** -
        npm install -g jshint
- **What is node used for?** - a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers

- **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?** - Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness
- **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?** - learning from other strudents. This also encapsulates engaged collaboration and social skills. However, currently, as a student, I am constantly learning. It is super beneficial as a learner to see how other students approach a problem, how they talk through their thoughts, how they delegate tasks, and how they actually work through their code.
- **How does pair programming work?** - it uses the Driver and the Navigator. The driver is the only one who touches a keyboard. They do all the typing and handling of the "mechanics" of coding. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not ever touch the computer. They think big picture and what comes next.

## Things I want to know more about

- I would like to learn more about Node in a hands on way, I'm excited to get some practice with it.
