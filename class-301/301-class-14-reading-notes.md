[Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

- **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?** - personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

- **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?** - This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

- **When are diversity efforts most successful?** - when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders.

- **Why do diverse companies perform better?** - Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones and there is a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

- **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.** - Left handed people helping to develop the technology we use, could make sure they are properly represented and that the tech that gets produced can be used easily by left handed people as well. Tech companies could also benefit from people who speak different languages, have visual impairments, physical handicaps, etc so that the tech being developed can be more accessible.
