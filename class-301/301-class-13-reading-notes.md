- **Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?** - PUT
- **Which REST methods require an ID parameter?** - DELETE, UPDATE

- **Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?** - REST is an architectural system centered around resources and hypermedia, via HTTP protocols. CRUD is a cycle meant for maintaining permanent records in a database setting. CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture.

- **If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?** - REQUIRE all the packages/configs/files you need, USE them, make sure your PORT is connected, add your ROUTES, add ERROR handling, and make sure everything is LISTENing.
